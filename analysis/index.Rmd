Analysis of RNASeq data from the 3way comparison of WT zebrafish samples with Heterozygous mutants for *psen2^S4Ter^* and Homozygous mutants for *psen2^S4Ter^*.
This mutant is expected to be a premature termination of the *psen2* gene, but instead an alternate downstream start site resulted in a near full-length transcript with significant similarity to a conventional Early Onset Familial Alzhemier's Disease mutation.

RNAseq was performed on total RNA with $n=4$ samples in each group.
Sequencing was performed by the sequencing facility at the Centre for Cancer Biology in Adelaide, using a NextSeq.
Reads were provided in as paired-end, 150bp reads.
